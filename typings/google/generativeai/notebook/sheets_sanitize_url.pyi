    """Sanitize a Sheets URL.

    Run some saftey checks to check whether `url` is a Sheets URL. This is not a
    general-purpose URL sanitizer. Rather, it makes use of the fact that we know
    the URL has to be for Sheets so we can make a few assumptions about (e.g. the
    domain).

    Args:
      url: The url to sanitize.

    Returns:
      The sanitized url.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If `url` does not match the expected restrictions for a Sheets
      URL.
