def parse_method_configs(interface_config, retry_impl=...):
    """Creates default retry and timeout objects for each method in a gapic
    interface config.

    DEPRECATED: instantiate retry and timeout classes directly instead.

    Args:
        interface_config (Mapping): The interface config section of the full
            gapic library config. For example, If the full configuration has
            an interface named ``google.example.v1.ExampleService`` you would
            pass in just that interface's configuration, for example
            ``gapic_config['interfaces']['google.example.v1.ExampleService']``.
        retry_impl (Callable): The constructor that creates a retry decorator
            that will be applied to the method based on method configs.

    Returns:
        Mapping[str, MethodConfig]: A mapping of RPC method names to their
            configuration.
