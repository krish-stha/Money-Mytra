    """Await a coroutine and retry if it fails.

    This is the lowest-level retry helper. Generally, you'll use the
    higher-level retry helper :class:`Retry`.

    Args:
        target(Callable[[], Any]): The function to call and retry. This must be a
            nullary function - apply arguments with `functools.partial`.
        predicate (Callable[Exception]): A callable used to determine if an
            exception raised by the target should be considered retryable.
            It should return True to retry or False otherwise.
        sleep_generator (Iterable[float]): An infinite iterator that determines
            how long to sleep between retries.
        timeout (Optional[float]): How long to keep retrying the target, in seconds.
            Note: timeout is only checked before initiating a retry, so the target may
            run past the timeout value as long as it is healthy.
        on_error (Optional[Callable[Exception]]): If given, the on_error
            callback will be called with each retryable exception raised by the
            target. Any error raised by this function will *not* be caught.
        exception_factory: A function that is called when the retryable reaches
            a terminal failure state, used to construct an exception to be raised.
            It takes a list of all exceptions encountered, a retry.RetryFailureReason
            enum indicating the failure cause, and the original timeout value
            as arguments. It should return a tuple of the exception to be raised,
            along with the cause exception if any. The default implementation will raise
            a RetryError on timeout, or the last exception encountered otherwise.
        deadline (float): DEPRECATED use ``timeout`` instead. For backward
            compatibility, if set it will override the ``timeout`` parameter.

    Returns:
        Any: the return value of the target function.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the sleep generator stops yielding values.
        Exception: a custom exception specified by the exception_factory if provided.
            If no exception_factory is provided:
                google.api_core.RetryError: If the timeout is exceeded while retrying.
                Exception: If the target raises an error that isn't retryable.

    """Exponential retry decorator for async coroutines.

    This class is a decorator used to add exponential back-off retry behavior
    to an RPC call.

    Although the default behavior is to retry transient API errors, a
    different predicate can be provided to retry other exceptions.

    Args:
        predicate (Callable[Exception]): A callable that should return ``True``
            if the given exception is retryable.
        initial (float): The minimum amount of time to delay in seconds. This
            must be greater than 0.
        maximum (float): The maximum amount of time to delay in seconds.
        multiplier (float): The multiplier applied to the delay.
        timeout (Optional[float]): How long to keep retrying in seconds.
            Note: timeout is only checked before initiating a retry, so the target may
            run past the timeout value as long as it is healthy.
        on_error (Optional[Callable[Exception]]): A function to call while processing
            a retryable exception. Any error raised by this function will
            *not* be caught.
        deadline (float): DEPRECATED use ``timeout`` instead. If set it will

            func (Callable): The callable or stream to add retry behavior to.
