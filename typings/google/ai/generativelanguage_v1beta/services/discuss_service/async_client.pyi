                Custom options for the client.

                1. The ``api_endpoint`` property can be used to override the
                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment
                variable, which have one of the following values:
                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always
                use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the
                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

                Required. The name of the model to use.

                Format: ``name=models/{model}``.

                This corresponds to the ``model`` field

                predicts is the next message in the

                This corresponds to the ``prompt`` field

            temperature (:class:`float`):
                Optional. Controls the randomness of the output.

                Values can range over ``[0.0,1.0]``, inclusive. A value
                closer to ``1.0`` will produce responses that are more
                varied, while a value closer to ``0.0`` will typically
                result in less surprising responses from the model.

                should not be set.

                Optional. The number of generated response messages to
                return.

                This value must be between ``[1, 8]``, inclusive. If
                unset, this will default to ``1``.

                This corresponds to the ``candidate_count`` field

                Optional. The maximum cumulative probability of tokens
                to consider when sampling.

                The model uses combined Top-k and nucleus sampling.

                Nucleus sampling considers the smallest set of tokens
                whose probability sum is at least ``top_p``.

                This corresponds to the ``top_p`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            top_k (:class:`int`):
                Optional. The maximum number of tokens to consider when
                sampling.

                The model uses combined Top-k and nucleus sampling.

                Top-k sampling considers the set of ``top_k`` most
                probable tokens.

                This corresponds to the ``top_k`` field
