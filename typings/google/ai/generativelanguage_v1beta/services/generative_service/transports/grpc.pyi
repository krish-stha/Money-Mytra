                A ``Channel`` instance through which to make calls, or a Callable
                that constructs and returns one. If set to None, ``self.create_channel``
                is used to create the channel. If a Callable is given, it will be called

            api_mtls_endpoint (Optional[str]): Deprecated. The mutual TLS endpoint.
                If provided, it overrides the ``host`` argument and tries to create
                a mutual TLS channel with client SSL credentials from

                and quota.
            client_info (google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo):
                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing
                your own client library.
