class Permission(proto.Message):
    r"""Permission resource grants user, group or the rest of the
    world access to the PaLM API resource (e.g. a tuned model,
    corpus).

    A role is a collection of permitted operations that allows users
    to perform specific actions on PaLM API resources. To make them
    available to users, groups, or service accounts, you assign
    roles. When you assign a role, you grant permissions that the
    role contains.

    There are three concentric roles. Each role is a superset of the
    previous role's permitted operations:

    - reader can use the resource (e.g. tuned model, corpus) for
      inference
    - writer has reader's permissions and additionally can edit and
      share
    - owner has writer's permissions and additionally can delete
