            Output only. The timestamp of when the ``File`` was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp of when the ``File`` was last
            updated.
        expiration_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp of when the ``File`` will be
            deleted. Only set if the ``File`` is scheduled to expire.
        sha256_hash (bytes):
            Output only. SHA-256 hash of the uploaded
            bytes.

            Output only. The uri of the ``File``.
        state (google.ai.generativelanguage_v1beta.types.File.State):
            Output only. Processing state of the File.
        error (google.rpc.status_pb2.Status):
