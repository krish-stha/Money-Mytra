class TunedModel(proto.Message):
    r"""A fine-tuned model created using
    ModelService.CreateTunedModel.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        tuned_model_source (google.ai.generativelanguage_v1beta.types.TunedModelSource):
            Optional. TunedModel to use as the starting
            point for training the new model.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``source_model``.
        base_model (str):
            Immutable. The name of the ``Model`` to tune. Example:
            ``models/gemini-1.5-flash-001``

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``source_model``.
        name (str):
            Output only. The tuned model name. A unique name will be
            generated on create. Example: ``tunedModels/az2mb0bpw6i`` If
            display_name is set on create, the id portion of the name
            will be set by concatenating the words of the display_name
            with hyphens and adding a random portion for uniqueness.

            Example:

            -  display_name = ``Sentence Translator``
            -  name = ``tunedModels/sentence-translator-u3b7m``
        display_name (str):
            Optional. The name to display for this model
            in user interfaces. The display name must be up
            to 40 characters including spaces.
        description (str):
            Optional. A short description of this model.
        temperature (float):
            Optional. Controls the randomness of the output.

            Values can range over ``[0.0,1.0]``, inclusive. A value
            closer to ``1.0`` will produce responses that are more
            varied, while a value closer to ``0.0`` will typically
            result in less surprising responses from the model.

            This value specifies default to be the one used by the base
            model while creating the model.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_temperature``.
        top_p (float):
            Optional. For Nucleus sampling.

            Nucleus sampling considers the smallest set of tokens whose
            probability sum is at least ``top_p``.

            This value specifies default to be the one used by the base
            model while creating the model.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_top_p``.
        top_k (int):
            Optional. For Top-k sampling.

            Top-k sampling considers the set of ``top_k`` most probable
            tokens. This value specifies default to be used by the
            backend while making the call to the model.

            This value specifies default to be the one used by the base
            model while creating the model.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_top_k``.
        state (google.ai.generativelanguage_v1beta.types.TunedModel.State):

            Output only. The timestamp when this model
            was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):

            was updated.
        tuning_task (google.ai.generativelanguage_v1beta.types.TuningTask):
            Required. The tuning task that creates the
            tuned model.
